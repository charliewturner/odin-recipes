    <p>There’s Grilled Cheese and there’s <strong>GREAT</strong> Grilled Cheese. Learn how to make the <em>best</em> Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a crisp, buttery exterior and gooey cheese center.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li><strong>Bread</strong> – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong> – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <p><ol>
        <li><strong>Butter the toast</strong> – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat skillet</strong> – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese</strong> – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the toast</strong> – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve </strong>– cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
